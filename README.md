```

Here is sample output:
```
Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America are all sitting around a room.  The other Avengers are also somewhere nearby.
As they are talking, Iron Man says 'Thor, I bet I can lift your hammer!'
'I'd like to see you try!' Thor responds
Captain America looks skeptical.  'Its not a good idea to mess with Thor's hammer' he says

Who will first try to pick up Thor's hammer? Thor
Thor walks over to the hammer and reaches down to pick it up.
'Of course, it is as light as paper for me' he brags.  'I am righteous; I can always pick it up'

Does Thor pick up the hammer? No
'I am a God.  I don't need to prove anything' says Thor.
Iron man looks down at him. 'You can't lift it.  I knew it!' he says.
Captain America walks over to the hammer, picks it up, and throws it to Thor.
'Yup, really is light as a feather' he says.
```
